# hr-barometer

We wanted to find out what motivates our employees to stay at tb.lx, and what could make them consider leaving. So, we asked these questions to the entire company and put together an HR barometer revealing the main drivers to Stay or Leave. 

You can find it here.

Having a proactive approach towards HR strategies is at our core: we not only care about employee retention, but also want to enable the best possible work environment by fostering a company ecosystem in which employees feel motivated to work in, and safe to express their ideas.

Are you curious to discover what motivates your teams? Apply our methodology to your reality and you too will find out.

Best wishes from tb.lx!
